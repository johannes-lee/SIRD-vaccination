# SIRD-vaccination
Individual-level SIRD contact model for studying vaccination prioritization (implemented in Python). 

Dependencies:
* Numpy
* Scipy
* PyTorch
* Matplotlib (for plotting)

Findings are similar to, but not equivalent to, the CDC vaccination prioritization guidelines for influenza: https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/national-strategy/planning-guidance/index.html.
